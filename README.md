# spectral_differentiation_and_inversion_in_Julia
This repository contains scripts that compute 1st- and 2nd-order derivatives and solve the Poisson equation in 1D and 2D using FFTW to compute discrete sine transforms and fast Fourier transforms in Julia. 2/3 rule de-aliasing tests are also performed.
